# learning-journey
I don't know what I'm doing.

This project is part of my journey to learn software development on the Internet Computer. It involves utilizing languages like Motoko, JavaScript, and React to build web applications and smart contracts.

## Description

This project serves as a personal learning platform for exploring the development of web applications and smart contracts on the Internet Computer. It combines Motoko, JavaScript, and React to build decentralized applications (dApps) and experiment with various features and functionalities.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different concepts, and modify the existing code to understand how Motoko, JavaScript, and React are utilized together. This project is not intended for production use, but rather for personal learning and experimentation purposes.
